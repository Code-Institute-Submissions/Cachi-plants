							<h4>How To Grow It</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Get yourself a sowing tray or pot and fill with compost – preferably peat-free!</li>
								<li>Place the seed paper on top – there is no need to cover it with more compost</li>
								<li>Water well</li>
								<li>Place the pot somewhere warm and light to germinate</li>
								<li>Keep the paper moist at all times – important!</li>
								<li>Once the seedlings are well established you can then transfer the whole lot to a
									bigger pot and grow on. Or you can individually remove each seedling and grow on in
									lots of small pots.</li>
								<li> When big enough – place in the garden and enjoy the Produce!</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>How Much Water Does It Need</h4>
							<p>Providing peppers with adequate water is essential
								from the moment the plants flower until the harvest.
								Deeply water the plants with 1 inch of water per week,
								and adjust the amount or frequency during hot, dry periods,
								after rainfall or if your soil is sandy and drains fast.
								Instead of flooding the soil with water when it's dry,
								keep it evenly moist. Drip irrigation is ideal for growing peppers,
								because it's economical, less labor intensive and delivers the water
								at the plant's roots without wetting the foliage and possibly
								triggering diseases.</p>
							<h4>How Much Sun Does It Need</h4>
							<p>Pepper plants need at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day/ Direct sun light is better</p>
